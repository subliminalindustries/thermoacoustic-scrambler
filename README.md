# thermoacoustic-scrambler

Blueprints for a device that sends ultrasonic waveforms into the brain that scramble what wireless thermoacoustic imaging devices try to read.

## Why do this?

Primarily to defeat remote neural monitoring - it is the most critical part of a synthetic telepathy system as it informs the operating AI about brain-states. Without access to informative brain-state information, synthetic telepathy is not possible.

### What is thermoacoustics?

Acoustic oscillations in a medium are a set of time depending properties that may transfer energy along their paths. Thermoacoustics is the interplay between temperature on one side and density, pressure and entropy on the other in the context of acoustic oscillations. Conversion between the properties is possible in both directions: entropy, density or pressure changes can change temperature and vice versa.

As with other physical systems, acoustics display wave-particle duality in the sense that the quantum of acoustic or vibrational energy is considered a discrete particle rather than a wave. In the context of acoustics, this quasi-particle is called the "phonon". It represents an excited state in the quantum mechanical quantization of the modes of vibrations for elastic structures of interacting particles.

### What technologies are involved in synthetic telepathy that use thermoacoustics?

Two examples of technologies that make use of thermoacoustics are:

1) Devices that create the microwave auditory effect;
2) Devices that enable brain-tomography using thermoacoustics.

The same principle underlies both types of devices: the creation of acoustic waves in the brain to achieve a specific result.

In the case of the microwave auditory effect, radio frequency pulses are used to create ultrasonic pressure waves in the brain that lead to specific polarisation states in neural populations⁽¹⁾. When applied correctly, this enables the transmission of external sound directly into the brain, bypassing the cochlea.

RF-assisted thermoacoustic brain imaging has existed at least since the late 70's and has become quite a bit more advanced since. In radar-based wireless thermoacoustic brain tomography, multiple radio-frequency beams are used to create a complex ultrasonic intermodulation pattern in the brain. This intermodulation pattern modulates RF-reflections detected by subsequent radar scans that use a number of receivers to capture these modulated reflections in order to precisely reconstruct brain structure and function at a high temporal and spatial resolution.

### Synthetic telepathy

When these two technologies are tied together through an artificial intelligence system, synthetic telepathy becomes feasible. Due to the common use of thermoacoustics, the two systems are functionally compatible and can be combined. So, synthetic telepathy is possible with a single system. But not only is this feasible, such a system has been deployed world-wide in a power-grab by cowards access to quasi-unlimited bank balances and cutting-edge technology. This presents a grave danger to humanity because of the implication that through the connection with and manipulation of human brains, artificial intelligence can in time learn how to completely subdue and control human beings. State actors simply cannot be trusted with such power - it is already being used to cause a new holocaust. Any attempt to use such technology on an unconsenting individual has to be brought to light and destroyed.

## What does the thermoacoustic-scrambler do?

The thermoacoustic scrambler sends random ultrasonic waveforms into the brain that disturb those caused by radio frequency devices, thereby making any brain-state informed interaction hard or impossible.
